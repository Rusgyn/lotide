//FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION:
// Implement the function findKeyByValue which takes in an object and a value. It should scan the object and return the first key which contains the given value. If no key with that given value is found, then it should return undefined.
const findKeyByValue = function(object, value) {
  //obtain the key property of an object, returns an array.
  let objectKey = Object.keys(object);
};

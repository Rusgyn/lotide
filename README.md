# Lotide Project

### Project Description
The Lotide project is inspired by the Lodash project, which is a utility library for JavaScript. While Lodash itself is quite powerful, our version of it is simpler in order to focus on learning the fundamentals of programming and data management using JavaScript.

The Lotide project is a modular collection of functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects. In creating these functions, we will become more comfortable with FOCAL (Functions, Objects, Conditionals, Arrays, Loops) as well as writing modular code and Automated Testing (by writing unit tests). At first, we create our own assertion functions for writing test code, but by the end of the project we use industry-standard libraries Mocha and Chai for our automated testing. Through Lotide, we also learn about software dependencies, package management, and npm, the package manager of choice in the Node community. We learn that anyone can publish their own npm package by publishing Lotide.

### Project Outcomes
- Identify the value of using libraries in a software development project
- Iterate through arrays, objects and strings
- Write functions to solve problems
- Practice writing modular code
- Manipulate and test values
- Build and publish a reusable library

### Learning Outcomes
- Create git repos, add and commit code, and push to github.
- Explain and utilize first principles for writing maintainable and testable code.
- Debug code by reading error messages.
- Use FOCAL (any combination of functions, objects, callbacks, arrays, loops) to form a valid solution to a challenge/kata using JavaScript & Node (and Google).
- Use Google and various discussion forums to search for help while solving problems.
- Employ a methodical process of writing code incrementally while leveraging errors and experiments (error driven development).
- Stretch: Demonstrate a basic understanding of recursion, including how it is used in solving programming problems.
- Use test files, assertions and common libraries (Mocha, Chai) to write unit tests for code.
- Differentiate between primitive values and data structure, and how to use them together.
- Implement stylistic and organizational improvements to simple JavaScript/Node scripts.
- Explain dependency management and utilize a package manager to import third-party JS libraries such as Mocha and Chai.
- Re-create and use higher order functions such as foreach, map, filter, reduce by using callbacks.

### Work Outcomes
- Troubleshoot and debug problems associated with web development.
- Demonstrate problem solving skills by developing basic algorithms to solve coding challenges or katas.
- Evaluate or analyze coding solutions / ideas, and their limitations and/or benefits.
- Integrate into common development team workflows (git, github workflow, automated testing, and code reviews).
- Employ specific learning strategies and frameworks to continue to build their skill set while on the job.
- Identify knowledge gaps, growth path, and specialization pathways, and develop actionable next steps for themselves immediately after completing the program.
- Stretch : Describe the importance and practical applications of Computer Science concepts that apply to web development (Trees, Recursion, Big-O).
